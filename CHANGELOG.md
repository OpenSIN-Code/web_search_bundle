## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-14

### Security

- Resolved all `gosec` findings (down from 53 to 0):
  - Fixed `G115` integer overflow in `internal/pool/keypool.go` by documenting the modulo-bound conversion.
  - Fixed `G703` path traversal in `internal/session/browser.go` (temp path is hardcoded) and `internal/alchemist/swarm.go` (sanitized strategy names via `sanitizeStrategyName`).
  - Hardened directory permissions from `0755` to `0750` for cache, sidecar, video, imaging, briefing, and alchemist history directories.
  - Hardened internal program file writes from `0644` to `0600` in `internal/alchemist/program_md.go` and `internal/alchemist/swarm.go`.
  - Added `gitCommand` helper in `internal/alchemist/git_ops.go` to centralize intentional git subprocess calls.
  - Added documented `#nosec` annotations for CLI-tool patterns that are inherently safe: reading user-supplied file paths, running configured external binaries (git, ffmpeg, yt-dlp), and HTTP requests to search/video endpoints.
  - Fixed two `G104` unhandled-error findings in `internal/secrets/infisical.go` and `internal/cache/cache.go`.

### Added

- Benchmarks for hot paths:
  - `internal/clustering/cluster_bench_test.go` — `Clusterer.Cluster` and `similarity`.
  - `internal/pool/keypool_bench_test.go` — `KeyPool.Next` and `KeyPool.Count`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- CI build failed because the `cmd/sin-websearch/` directory was ignored by `.gitignore` (pattern `sin-websearch` matched any directory with that name). Changed to `/sin-websearch` to only ignore the root binary.
- `internal/secrets/` was ignored by the global `.gitignore_global` `secrets/` pattern. Force-added `infisical.go` and its CoDocs companion.
- Resolved all `golangci-lint` `errcheck` findings across the codebase:
  - `internal/engines/video.go` — `os.MkdirAll` errors
  - `internal/engines/whisper.go` — `writer.WriteField` errors
  - `internal/imaging/resize.go` — `os.MkdirAll` error
  - `internal/briefing/video_html.go` — `os.MkdirAll` error
  - `internal/alchemist/daemon.go` — `git.ReturnToMainBranch` and `git.Restore` errors
  - `internal/server/http.go` — `json.Encoder.Encode` error
  - `cmd/sin-websearch/watch_cmd.go` — `engine.Cleanup` error
- Removed unused `sync.Mutex` from `internal/alchemist/daemon.go`.
- Removed unused `redact()` helper from `internal/server/http.go`.

### Changed

- `internal/experiment/loop_test.go` — removed ineffectual `reason` assignments.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **HTTP API for alchemist and swarm**
  - `POST /api/v1/alchemist` — run a single autonomous research loop.
  - `POST /api/v1/alchemist/swarm` — run a multi-strategy parallel swarm.
  - Request validation, defaults, and safety-mode enforcement.
- **MCP alchemist tool**
  - `websearch_alchemist` supports both single-daemon and swarm modes.
- **Alchemist tests and bug fixes**
  - Smoke tests for strategies, `ProgramMD`, history, literature loader, and swarm.
  - Fixed `ProgramMD` parsing bug where the word "learning" in a hypothesis line switched sections.
  - Fixed `ProgramMD` flush to persist added hypotheses and update `rawContent`.
  - Fixed daemon panic when generating the morning report (nil context passed to `git diff`).
  - Moved SQLite history creation into `daemon.Run()` after the work-branch checkout.
  - Swarm now commits per-strategy `program.<strategy>.md` so the work tree is clean.
- **Documentation**
  - `docs/alchemist.md` with full usage guide for alchemist and swarm.
  - HTTP API examples added to `README.md` and `docs/alchemist.md`.
  - `AGENTS.md` updated with new MCP tools and HTTP endpoints.
- **CI**
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with `go test`, `go build`, `go vet`, `go mod verify` for Go 1.23/1.24, and `golangci-lint`.

### Changed

- `MorningReport.RenderMarkdown()` now falls back to simple rendering when template parsing fails.

### Deprecated

- `OpenSIN-Code/SIN-Code-Websearch-Skill` — archived, superseded by `web_search_bundle`.
- `OpenSIN-Code/SIN-Websearch-SerpAPI-Bundle` — archived, superseded by `web_search_bundle`.
- `OpenSIN-Code/SIN-Code-Bundle` (Python legacy) — no longer exists; active stack is `OpenSIN-Code/SIN-Code` (Go).

### Fixed

- `TestHandleAlchemist` no longer receives empty markdown because `RenderMarkdown()` falls back to `renderSimple()`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- HTTP REST API with `/health`, `/api/v1/search`, `/api/v1/search/stream`, `/api/v1/pulse`, `/api/v1/resolve`.
- SQLite-based caching and key rotation.
- Infisical / environment secret loading.
- Cobra CLI and Viper configuration.
